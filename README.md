# RESTful-API-using-Flask-only
Here is a basic RESTful API using Flask module only 

Hey! I hope all is well with everyone! Here is the read me for installing packages in this repository:

Step1: Install these packages for a RESTful API:

     pip3 install flask
     pip3 install jsonify 
     pip3 install request (if you need to)
     
Step2: That is all! I decided to upload this to my repository to demonstrate how a basic RESTful API works! 

Happy Coding!
